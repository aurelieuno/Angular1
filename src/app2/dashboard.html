<h2>Top 3 Heroes</h2>


<li *ngFor="let hero of heroes"
[routerLink]="['/detail',hero.id]"

<span>{{hero.id}}</span> <span>{{hero.name}}</span>
</li>



<!-- The hero property is an input property
 the parent AppComponent will tell the child HeroDetailComponent which hero to display
 by binding its selectedHero to the hero property of the HeroDetailComponent.
 Putting square brackets around the hero property, to the left of the equal sign (=), makes it the target of a property binding expression.
 You must declare a target binding property to be an input property. Otherwise, Angular rejects the binding and throws an error. -->
